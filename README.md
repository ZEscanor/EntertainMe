Version 1 of Entertainment App.


Welcome to the Entertainment App! The goal is to create something that will make it easier to find local events in your area, and give you a detailed description on things like pricing, distance, and availability.

This App is a work in Progress and right now for v1 it allows you to look up any location in the world and gives you a personalized Map that places markers around your location based on available events.


This App is split into two Maps, A light map that Searches for Nearby Restaurants, Bars, and Points of Interest around a location.

The Dark Map searches for Entertainment events like Music, Arts and Sports.
